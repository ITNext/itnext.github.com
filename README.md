# Simple Portfolio

This code is a simple, personal, and visual portfolio.
For now, it is dedicated to be used on steren.fr.

Content is defined in `data.json`.


## Using this code

It is not recommended to import elements from `polymer-project.org` as it is done in this code. If you want somethign more stable:

Install [bower](http://bower.io/) and run `bower install` in the main directory, components will be installed locally.

Then replace using your favorite editor `polymer-project.org` imports with local imports in all `.html` files:
`<link rel="import" href="//www.polymer-project.org/components/****">` by `<link rel="import" href="components/****">`
